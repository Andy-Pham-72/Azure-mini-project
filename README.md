# Azure Mini Project
## Databricks with Walmart dataset

## Goals
In this mini-project, you will learn how to:
- Deploy a Databricks cluster.
- Work with content stored in Azure Blob Storage and accessed by the Spark cluster as an HDFS volume.
- Use a Jupyter Notebook to interactively explore a large dataset.
- Delete a cluster to avoid incurring unnecessary charges.

## Step 1: upload file to Azure Blob Storage using [upload_file.sh](https://github.com/Andy-Pham-72/Azure-mini-project/blob/master/upload_file.sh)

## Step 2: upload [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/Andy-Pham-72/Azure-mini-project/blob/master/notebook/Spark%20DataFrames%20Project%20Exercise.ipynb) to Databricks cluster
